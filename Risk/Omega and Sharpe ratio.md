# Omega and Sharpe ratio
> Omega ratio; Sharpe ratio

## 1. Abstract

This paper shows that Omega Ratio and Sharpe Ratio are strongly connected when the underlying distribution is elliptic, i.e., Omega Ratio is increasing function of Sharpe Ratio w.r.t. $\mu$, the expected return of portfolio. A straightforward consequence of such monotonic relationship is that maximizing Omega ratio is the same as maximizing Sharpe Ratio at a given level of volatility in the field of portfolio optimization. 

## 2. Omega Ratio
- Omega Ratio Definition  
$$\Omega(\theta) = \frac{\int_{\theta}^{\infty}[1-F(r)]dr}{\int_{-\infty}^{\theta}F(r)dr}$$   
where $\theta$ is a threshold defining what is considered a gain verse a loss.   

- $\lim_{\theta\to-\infty}\Omega(\theta) = \infty$  and
- $\lim_{\theta\to \infty}\Omega(\theta) = 0$.
- An asset dominates another asset happens when one curve of a portfolio above all the other one for any value of $\theta$.
